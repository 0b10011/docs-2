# What is Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

# How to use this image

## 1. create a `Dockerfile` in your ruby app project
    FROM ruby
    CMD ["./your-daemon-or-script.rb"]

Put this file in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`.

This image includes multiple `ONBUILD` triggers so that should be all that you need to bootstrap most applications.  The build will `ADD . /usr/src/app` and `RUN bundle install`.

## 2. build the ruby app image
    docker build -t my-ruby-app .

## 3. start the ruby app container
    docker run -it --name some-ruby-app my-ruby-app

# Issues and Contributing

If you have any questions about the image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/ruby/issues) or in the IRC channel `#docker-library` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).

If you want to contribute, we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/ruby/issues) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it. Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.
