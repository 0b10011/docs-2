# What is Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

# How to use this image

## 1. create a `Dockerfile` in your ruby app project
    FROM ruby
    CMD ["./your-daemon-or-script.rb"]

Put this file in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`.

This image includes multiple `ONBUILD` triggers so that should be all that you need to bootstrap most applications.  The build will `ADD . /usr/src/app` and `RUN bundle install`.

## 2. build the ruby app image
    docker build -t my-ruby-app .

## 3. start the ruby app container
    docker run -it --name some-ruby-app my-ruby-app

# Issues and Contributing

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/ruby/issues) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it. Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

## Conventions

Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch.

Update this documentation when creating or modifying features. Test your documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness.

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference to all the issues that they address.

Commit messages should start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars) written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the suggested modifications and force push amended commits to your feature branch. Be sure to post a comment after pushing. The changed commits will show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you comment.

Before the pull request is merged, make sure that you squash your commits into logical units of work using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. Include documentation changes in the same commit so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix.

Commits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like Closes #XXXX or Fixes #XXXX, which will automatically close the issue when merged.
