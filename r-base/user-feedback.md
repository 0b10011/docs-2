## Contributing

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small;
we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them
as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans %%MAILING_LIST%%
through a [GitHub issue](%%GITHUB_REPO%%/issues), especially for more ambitious
contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right
direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone
else is working on the same thing.
