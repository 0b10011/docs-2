# What is hylang?

Hy (alternately, Hylang) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language designed to interoperate with Python by translating expressions into Python's abstract syntax tree (AST). Similar to Clojure's mapping of s-expressions onto the JVM, Hy is meant to operate as a transparent Lisp front end to Python's abstract syntax. Hy also allows for Python libraries (include the standard library) to be imported and accessed alongside Hy code with a compilation step, converting the data structure of both into Python's AST.
