# CentOS

CentOS (abbreviated from Community Enterprise Operating System) is a Linux
distribution that attempts to provide a free, enterprise-class,
community-supported computing platform which aims to be 100% binary compatible
with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In January 2014, it
was announced that CentOS was officially joining forces with Red Hat while
staying independent from RHEL, under a new CentOS Governing Board.

This is the official CentOS image, and will be updated on a regular schedule or
as needed for emergency fixes.

The `centos:latest` tag will always point to the most recent version currently
available, and `centos:centos6` will point to the latest version of the CentOS 6 tree.
