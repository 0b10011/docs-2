## Contributing

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large
or small; I am always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do my
best to process them as fast as I can.

Before you start to code, I recommend discussing your plans through a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/ahawkins/docker-thrift/issues),
especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other
contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you
feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is
working on the same thing.
