## Contributing

If you want to contribute new features or updates, we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible.

We recommend discussing your plans %%MAILING_LIST%% through a [GitHub issue](%%REPO%%/issues) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.
